A plugin for WordPress to make it easy to include Processing JS sketches into blog posts.

Visit [the plugin page](http://www.keyvan.net/code/processing-js/) for more information.

== Installation ==

The easiest way to install the plugin is to use the plugin installer in WordPress.

If you want to do it manually:

1. Upload the `processingjs` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Once activated, you'll notice a 'processing' button when you're writing or editing a post in HTML mode. Clicking it will insert a very simple Processing sketch into your post. You can use it as a template or write your own from scratch. You'll find examples (with code) of what can be done here: [Processing JS Demos](http://processingjs.org/learning).
